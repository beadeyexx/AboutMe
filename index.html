            Hello everyone! My name is Hasabeah Alombro, but you can call me Beah. 
            People always ask me <br> the origin of my name, but the truth is, even I am not sure. I was born in Zamboanga City on January 3, 2000, 
            <br> now I live in Taguig City.
            <br><br>I share my space with four silly cats, who often ask for affection and food.
            <br>I enjoy both socializing with people I'm comfortable with and spending quiet time at home. Whether it's hanging out with friends
            <br> or curling up to watch a movie, I find joy in different activities and appreciate a good balance between social interaction and alone time.
        </p>
